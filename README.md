## Phillip's Github Pages

I've been meaning to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a little while now anyways. This is super cool.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

And I can put code blocks in for **multiple languages**? This is dope!

```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
    return "Hello there " + name + ", nice to meet you!";
}

const visitor = prompt("What is your name?");

alert(greeting(visitor));
```

### Jekyll Themes

I am using the Jekyll theme selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/pb4000/pb4000.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
